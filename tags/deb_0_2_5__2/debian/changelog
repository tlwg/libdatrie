libdatrie (0.2.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * VCS moved from CVS to SVN; update Vcs-* fields accordingly.

    - Rename binary packages according to SONAME change, to allow run-time
      coexistence with old version: libdatrie1, libdatrie1-bin
    - Rename libdatrie0-dev to libdatrie-dev, and conflicts with
      libdatrie0-dev, as both versions share the same headers location;
      this should be the package naming scheme from now on
    - Ditto to libdatrie-doc
  * Shared lib updates:
    - debian/rules:
      + Bump shlib dep to 0.2.0, and shlib package is now libdatrie1

      + Update symbols, setting minver to 0.2.0 for all symbols
  * Bump debhelper compat to level 7
    - Bump debian/compat to 7

      + Replace obsoleted 'dh_clean -k' with 'dh_prep'

    - Install README.migration provided by upstream
  * debian/copyright:
    - Update format to proposal rev 454
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.8.1 (no changes needed)

  * Fix CVSROOT in Vcs-Cvs, so it really works with debcheckout.
  * debian/libdatrie0-doc.doc-base: Correct doc-base section (Programming).
  * debian/rules:
    - Update config.{guess,status} before configure, and clean them up on

    - Use 'make -C $dir' instead of 'cd $dir; make'
    - Do not build/install doc on binary-arch

    *.tar.gz.md5sum.

    - Add DM-Upload-Allowed
    - Bump Standards-Versions to 3.8.0 (no changes needed)
